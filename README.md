# Refactor-Accessability-web

## Description
Like the title heis named, the goal of this projecot is to refacotor the webstie to make it more accessiable for various of people. There are alot of people with different disability or some one who doesnt have a disability to choose to use tools that helps them with their everydays. In this project I thougth what would be the best approach through coding. One of them is adding semantic instead of divs, using alt to pictures/videos/gifs, and cleaning up the code to make it easier to read/understand. By using those tools is helps the users perfrom better in their day to day like using a screen reader, braille, sub/dubbing, etc. I learnt how to use semantic better.

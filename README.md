Like the title heis named, the goal of this projecot is to refacotor the webstie to make it more accessiable for various of people. There are alot of people with different disability or some one who doesnt have a disability to choose to use tools that helps them with their everydays. In this project I thougth what would be the best approach through coding. One of them is adding semantic instead of divs, using alt to pictures/videos/gifs, and cleaning up the code to make it easier to read/understand. By using those tools is helps the users perfrom better in their day to day like using a screen reader, braille, sub/dubbing, etc. I learnt how to use semantic better.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

I used the tools that I had on my computer like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, I cloned the repo into my local file, made a github repo and named both the local and global repo "Refactor-accessability-web". I opened the file in my vscode and started coding the project and used chrome developer tools to live check the website for errors and stuffs. Then I push it into my github for deployment.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

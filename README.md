# Refactor-Accessability-web

## Description
As the title is named, the goal of this project is to refactor the website to make it more accessible to various audiences. There are a lot of people with different disability or someone who can't choose to use tools that helps them with their everyday. In this project, I thought about what would be the best approach through coding. One of ways is to add semantics instead of divs, using alt to pictures/videos/gifs, and cleaning up the code to make it easier to read/understand. Using those tools helps the users perform better in their day-to-day like using a screen reader, braille, sub/dubbing, etc. I learned how to use semantics better.

## Installation

I used the tools that I had on my computer, like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, I cloned the repo into my local file, made a GitHub repo, and named both the local and global repo the "Refactor-accessibility-web". I opened the file in my VScode and started coding the project, and used Chrome developer tools to live to check the website for errors and stuff. Then I push it into my GitHub for deployment.
